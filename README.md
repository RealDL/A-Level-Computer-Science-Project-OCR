# A-Level-Computer-Science-Project-OCR
This contains all my 6 sprints with the code, pseudo code and program code itself. It will include links to video proof but mainly is a list of resources I can use to link back to.

# What it contains
 - Each Sprint folder will contain the program code, pseudo code and the program itself in a zip folder.

This will be used as an online resource to hold and link back to my code etc.
