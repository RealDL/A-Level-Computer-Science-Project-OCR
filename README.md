# A-Level Computer Science Project OCR
Hey there. This is my GitHub which I am using to store all of my program code, pseudo code and the program itself for each sprint.
It will include links to video proof but mainly is a list of resources I can use to link back to.
Feel free to take from my project as this project would not be possible without further developing a client-server connection
from tech with tim and as well as using code from clear code to create my game.

# What it contains
 - Each Sprint folder will contain the program code, pseudo code and the program itself in a zip folder.

This will be used as an online resource to hold and link back to my code etc.

# My Results
For anyone wondering I achieved 59/70 for my Computer Science Coursework which is an A; and a few marks off an A*.
